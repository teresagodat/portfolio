          <h1>The Necessity of Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing</h1>
        
          <p>
             How do websites function? More importantly, how do they work with all different types of browsers and devices? That is what web developers should worry about every time they create a website or update their code. In comes cross-browser compatibility testing; which I believe is by far one of the most important things you can do before implementing a new site or introducing new code. Testing a variety of different browsers may seem to be daunting and time consuming, but you will thank yourself later for the upfront effort. 
          </p>
          <p> 
              The problem is browsers behave differently and not everyone uses the same browser.  If you are small organization you could make your users use the same browser and develop towards that; however, in large organizations, or having the public as your user, that is impossible.  Browsers also perform differently between devices. Today, many users are using their mobile devices as their main source of connection to the internet. Your site must be able to be responsive to all forms of devices. This means, as a web developer, it is up to you to figure out a way to make sure different browsers and devices can handle your code to where the site is not broken or looks awful.  
          </p> 
          <p>
              The good news is there are web standards that a developer should use that will help reduce browser issues. W3C Standards are created based on the consensus of the web community, encourages equality, responsiveness and growth. The standards are a guide for web developers to use to help ensure their sites can be seen by all types of users. The best part, the standards are available to everyone, and at no cost!
          </p>
          <p>
              Even if a developer uses the web standards to improve their site, it is super important to test the site in the most common browsers used; which could vary based on demographics.  The site doesn’t have to look exactly alike between the different browsers, but the code should “function” the same, meaning the results should be similar but don’t have to be exact because browsers do not act the same. 
          </p> 
          <p>
              There are different methods and tools that developers can use to ensure their sites will work between different browsers.  It is definitely a good idea to have the most up to date versions of the most common browsers installed on your computer and test your site with each browser to ensure no issues.  The best bet is to get a multi-browser viewer of some sort so you can not only test the most common browsers, but you can also test several of the different versions of each the browsers.  Just like you cannot control which browser the visitors to your site will use, you have no idea which version of the browser they are using.  
          </p>
          <p>
              Cross-browser compatibility testing will not get rid of all browser issues. You cannot possibly test every scenario before your site goes live. You will have browser issues; however, testing that your site works in different browsers will not only make your boss or clients happy, it will make your life a bit less stressful and a lot less bug fixes.  
          </p>
           <p>
              Go forth and test many browsers!
