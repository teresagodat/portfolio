      <h4>A Little About Me:</h4>
    </header>
      <p>About six years ago I ended up working on a large scale IT project that turned into a software testing career. It sparked an interest I never knew I had. I <em>LOVE</em> code. Who would have known!
      <br>
      <p>I'm currently working on getting my HTML5, CSS3, &amp; Responsive Design for Web Development certificate.  After completing the certificate program, my goal is to become a web developer; both professionally and personally.</p> 
      <aside> I would really like to donate my time to my church or my son's private school in assisting with their websites.</aside>
      <p>When I'm not coding or working, I am spending time with my husband, our 3 year old son and our fur babies. </p>
